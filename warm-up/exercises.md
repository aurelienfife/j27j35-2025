# 🐍 Python Warm-up Progression (Easy → Hard)

## Level 1 – Basic I/O & Strings
1. **Greeting the User**  
   Ask for name + age → print:  
   `"Hello <name>, you are <age> years old!"`  
   *(input, output, concatenation)*  

2. **Word Reversal**  
   Ask the user for a word and print it reversed.  
   *(string slicing, output)*  

---

## Level 2 – Simple Math
3. **Simple Calculator**  
   Take two numbers as input → print sum, difference, product, and quotient.  
   *(input, calculations, type conversion)*  

4. **Even or Odd**  
   Write a function that checks if a number is even or odd.  
   *(functions, if/else)*  

---

## Level 3 – Lists & Loops
5. **List Summation**  
   Given a list of numbers, calculate the total using a loop.  
   *(lists, for-loops, accumulation)*  

6. **List Minimum and Maximum**  
   Find the smallest and largest numbers in a list (without using `min()`/`max()`).  
   *(lists, loops, comparisons)*  

---

## Level 4 – Conditionals
7. **Grade Checker**  
   Ask the user for a score (0–100).  
   - **0–49 → F**  
   - **50–59 → C**  
   - **60–69 → B**  
   - **70+ → A**  
   *(if/elif/else, logic)*  

---

## Level 5 – Looping Practice
8. **Multiplication Table**  
   Print the multiplication table (1–10) for a number entered by the user.  
   *(loops, input, formatted output)*  

9. **Shopping List Manager**  
   Start with an empty list. Ask the user to enter items one by one until they type `"done"`.  
   After that, **print the full list at the end**.  
   *(lists, while-loops, break condition)*  

---

## Level 6 – Functions + Logic
10. **Prime Finder**  
   Write a function to check if a number is prime.  
   👉 *Reminder: A prime number is greater than 1 and divisible only by 1 and itself.*  
   Then, use the function to print all primes from 1–50.  
   *(functions, loops, conditionals combined)*
